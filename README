README[x] WebLog Triage [x]

Analysing large volumes of web server access logs to identify malicious behaviour is tedious and error-prone. WebLogTriage helps streamline this process.

WebLogTriage is a powerful tool for parsing and analysing web server access logs (e.g., Apache, Nginx) to detect suspicious activity. It normalises logs into a standard DataFrame format for efficient querying and applies risk-scoring rules to highlight potential threats.

User-defined Sigma-style rules and detection signatures help uncover scanning tools, webshells, and other malicious patterns.

** Features **

  - Log Parsing: Supports 6+ access log formats including Apache and Nginx, converting them into a unified Pandas DataFrame for structured analysis.
  - User Defined Rules: Applies custom rules (defined in rules.yaml) to detect threats based on fields like IP, URI path, status code, user-agent, and more. Matching entries are tagged with a rule name and risk score.
  - Malicious Tool Detection: Detects common web scanners (e.g., DirSearch) using patterns defined in config.yaml. Known webshell paths listed in shells.txt are flagged.
  - Flexible Filtering: Supports queries by URI keywords, IP addresses (including CIDR ranges), HTTP methods, HTTP status codes, timestamp ranges, and more. See Usage section for examples.
  - Timestamp Clustering: Detects gaps between timestamps and clusters related activity into distinct sessions. Terminal output highlights a new session in blue.

** Output Options **

  - Terminal output with colored highlights for quick inspection
  - CSV output for in-depth analysis
  - Email support for sending reports
  - Optional filtering of static files (e.g., .js, .css)


** Installation ** 

Install WebLogTriage using pip:

> pip install .

Ensure config.yaml, rules.yaml, and shells.txt are present. See Configuration for details.

** Configuration ** 

  - config.yaml: Specifies configuration options, including settings for risk score calculation (e.g., sensitive paths like /admin, extensions like .sql). Tool signature definition for detecting scanners like DirSearch. See config.yaml for examples.

  - rules.yaml: Defines Sigma-style matching rules to flag suspicious log entries and assign risk scores. See rules.yaml for examples.

  - shells.txt: A list of known webshell filenames (e.g., cmd.php, wshell.jsp), used for URI risk detection.

** Usage **

Run via the main script:

> ./triage.py --help

Examples:

1. Analyse Logs with Default Settings - Process all logs in a directory, apply rules from rules.yaml, detect scanning tools, and filter out static file extensions (e.g., .js, .css):

> ./triage.py --path WebLogs/

2. Filter High-Risk Entries - Show entries with a risk score of 70 or higher (based on rules.yaml):

> ./triage.py --path WebLogs/accesslog1.txt --risk-score 70

3. Focus on Scanning Tool Activity - Display an overview of detected malicious scanning tools and related log entries:

> ./triage.py --path WebLogs/ --tool-focus

4. Filter PUT Requests by IP and Output to CSV - Extract successful PUT requests from specific IPs or CIDR ranges, outputting full details in CSV format:

> ./triage.py --path WebLogs/ --method PUT --ip 192.168.1.1 10.10.10.0/24 --status 200 --output-format csv

5. Filter POST Requests by Time Range - Show successful POST requests within a specific time window:

> ./triage.py --path WebLogs/ --start-time "2025-04-21 18:23:00+10" --end-time "2025-04-21 18:24:00+10" --method POST --status 200

6. Search for Suspicious URIs with High Request Counts - Filter logs for URIs containing “upload” with over 1000 requests, adjusting timestamps by 300 seconds (5 minutes) to correct any time skew in logs:

> ./triage.py --path WebLogs/ --uripath-keyword "upload" --time-offset 300 --request-count 1000

7. Identify Logs with Uncommon Status Codes - Exclude common HTTP status codes and limit static file filtering to .php and .js:

> ./triage.py --path WebLogs/fj* --ignore-status-code 200 404 500 302 400 403 401 301 --ignore-extension php js

8. Filter by Referrer and User Agent, Email Results Identify logs with a specific referrer and user agent, emailing results in CSV format:

> ./triage.py --path WebLogs --referrer fofa.info --ua "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:135.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/135.0" --email terry.uppercut@gmail.com

** Output **

  - Terminal Output (default): Provides a concise overview of log entries, truncating some fields for readability. Ideal for exploring data and identifying entries of interest.
  - CSV Output (--output-format csv): Includes all fields without truncation, suitable for detailed analysis or reporting.
  - Email - With the --email option, send results to an address in CSV format.

To customise output, adjust filtering options (e.g., --ignore-extension) or use CSV mode for full data.

** Error Handling **

  - Parsing failures or unsupported formats are logged to error.log.
  - To support new log formats, add patterns to access_log_formats in parser.py.
